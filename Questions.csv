2,"A class is declared without a namsespace as below 
private class Person
{
}
Will the file compile?",B,1,"The following example generates CS1527 error.  Because a class should be declared in with in a namsepace, when no namespace is explicitly declared all type declarations are located implicitly within the global namespace. A class can not be declared private within a namespace.
