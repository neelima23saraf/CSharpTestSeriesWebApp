1,Can a class have any access specifier ?,B,1,"Elements defined in a namespace cannot be explicitly declared as private, protected, protected internal or private protected. A Class within a namespace can only be declared public or internal.",Yes,No,,

private class Person
{
}
Will the file compile?",B,1,"The following example generates CS1527 error.

16,Boxing and unboxing are computationally expensive processes,A,2,,Yes,No,,
17,Where is value type stored?,A,2,,Stack,Heap,,
18,Where is reference type stored?,B,2,,Stack,Heap,,
19,An abstract class should have atleast one abstract method and class implementing this abstract class should override this method,A,3,,Yes,No,,
20,We can create an object of an abstract class,B,3,,Yes,No,,
21,We can have virtual methods in an abstract class,A,3,,Yes,No,,
22,Interface is a contract. Whichever class inherits the Interface has to  implement these contract,B,4,An interface can not be inherited. It can only be implemented. ,Yes,No,,
23,Everything in an interface is public?,A,4,,Yes,No,,
24," While inheriting from base class, base class name should be first thing after colon(:)",A,4,,Yes,No,,
25,Can we create an object of an Interface?,B,4,,Yes,No,,
26,We can implement  from multiple infterfaces ,A,4,,Yes,No,,
27,We inherit class but ------ interface,B,4,,Inherit,Implements,Derive,Create
